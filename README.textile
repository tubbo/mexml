h1. MeXML: Message eXchange Markup Language

MeXML is a language for describing e-mail messages, based on "XML":http://www.w3.org/XML/ and designed for web application development. MeXML makes it easy to generate templates for e-mails the way you see them, even including XHTML 1.0 formatting elements in the DOCTYPE. In fact, MeXML files behave exactly like HTML files only with different headers!

h2. examples

an example message is provided in this repo ("example.mex") that shows off all of MeXML's features, but here's a short one just to show how easy and beautiful it is to create e-mails with MeXML!

h2. rendering

MeXML will include parsers for various languages, including Ruby, Python and PHP. It is geared towards web development and thus is focused primarily on languages which support a "web application framework":http://en.wikipedia.org/Web_Application_Framework.
